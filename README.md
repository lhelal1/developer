## Welcome and Acknoledgments

Welcome to my personal portfolio. This is the central repository of the [entropywith.me](https://entropywith.me) project. In a nutshell, this is a personal project I figured out to stimulate people to gather knowledge from apparently non-related fields against your field of work. My intention is to inspire, through my daily activities, people to accumulate skills in basics and applied sciences as well as to have the joy to assembly your own stuff.

## What is it about?

I hope you enjoy what I do seriously; just for fun; or just for curiosity! So, please do not expect to find everything perfect and crystal clear in all folders/sub-folders.

The intention here is to share openly as I can attempts, assemblies, errors, real-life mistakes, in a journey of an epidemiologist/engineer-prototype/dev-dreamer.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Below you can find the folder structure under the <code>LH</code> main folder that is available in the `development` branch. The vast majority of my projects are quite solo, but I have the hands of my master's candidate <code>@RafaelaRibeiro</code>, as well as Dr. <code>@TayrineOrdonio</code>.

As for programming languages, my focus is on scientific computing. Then, for *general purpose language - GLP*, I mostly go with <code> C/C++ </code>/<code>Python</code>. 

<br>

> Fun fact: my first programming language was <code> R Language </code>, mostly to solve applied problems in Epidemiology/Statistics. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
This triggered me an interest beyond problem-solving applied to my field. Indeed, I cannot fit myself into a single area, and this has a lot to do with my background.

<br>

## My Background
<p>
I always had affinity with hard sciences. Back in the 2005, I started the graduate course in [Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture). I got two years, when I learned important skills till today: <strong> a. Technical Drawing; b. Computer Assisted Design (aka "CAD"); c. Art History; d. Architectonical Elements; e. Civil Engineering; f. Documentation</strong>. I'm hardly influenced by knowledge which I was exposed 20 years ago...

<br>

<p>

<br>

In 2007, there was time to move. I was looking for more hard sciences, but still applied in a while. That was when I shifted to [IEEE - Electrical and Electronics Engineering](wikipedia.org/IEEE), at [Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](www.ufsc.br). For a lack of maturity, influenced by my times in triathlon, about 2 years later, I suspended the course. And such a big irony, those years on health and Epidemiology triggered me to <strong> get back to Engineering - yes, I will return formally to Engineering School!</strong>.

<br>

<p>
More recently, important topics I was exposed in EEE came hard to surface: <strong>a. Calculus; b. Numerical Analysis; c. Probability (I'm a stats professor, by the way); c. Linear Algebra; d. Scientific Computation; e. and a lot...</strong>. Then, I started my own <strong>workbench</strong>. 

<br>

<p>
From the bench to the thermal comfort, every single piece of that office was made by myself. Please, <em>try to assembly yourself</em>. There are not such pleasant things in life to realize that you made that whole thing. And this is what inspired me to, beyond sharing my journey to an <strong>engineer</strong> again, try to make it open for you if you are a curious mind. To formally endeavor and technically answer by a project, you need a graduation in the field. But, for knowledge, there is <strong>no borders at all!</strong> - and I warrant you that you will make use of every single piecee of knowledge of your tool box - even though not applied, at least it makes you <em>smarter ;)</em>!

<br>

<p>
<br>
Then, because all of this, I self-taugthly expanded my tiny repertory (the ordinary resources a scientist rely whilst there are way more to expand), such:

<br>
<br>

## A taste of what you can do.

<list>
<li>From MacOS only I added Linux distros in my assets, mainly <code><strong>Fedora Scientific</strong>, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Arch Linux</code>

<li>I leaned fundamental GPL programming languages for a scientist, either low-mid level (<code>C/C++/Java</code>) to high level (<code>Python and Rust </code>) 

<li>Can't live anymore without <code>Terminal/Bash/Zsh</code>

<li>Can't live anymore without <code>version control - Git/GitHub</code>

<li>When I need to run <code>R</code>, I automatically do this through <code>Visual Studio Code</code>

<li>I'm not a front end developer, but I designed the [entropywith.me](https://entropywith.me) in <code>Figma</code> and deployed using the <code>Node.js</code> framework

<li>I expanded my repertory of <code>domain-language purpose</code> towards <code> MATLAB, Octave, Julia, CAD/CAE/CAS C++/Java/Python-based softwares

<li>I turned myself proficcient in <code>LaTeX</code> and <code>Markdown</code>

<li>I can solve basic problems of computer architecture, OS, network routing...

<li>In a daily-basis, I study <strong>Calculus</strong>, <strong>Diff. Equations</strong>, <strong>Algebra</strong>, <strong>Arithmetics and Numeric Analysis</strong> or <strong>Trigonometry (also in the Complex Field)</strong>

<li>I feel safe to work with low voltage electrical circuits for me, for my place, for my family or even for you

<li>The same is true for electronics

<li>I learned how to get rid the rusty of an iron piece by eletrolysis

<li>And also with not so trivial electrical tools

<li>If there is something needed to solve I don't know, I ask for two days (or an extension if needed) to study about. 
For the vast majority, I accomplish the goal - and learn something new

<li>I leaned the value to know what workers focused on hand/hard-work do is fundamental to pursuit a leadership position

<li>I realocated my office from the internal room to the external room, combined with my workbench

<li>I have a complete set of decent tools; I have goods in stock to assembly; and I use them at a daily basis.
